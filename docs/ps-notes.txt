Notes on how ps gets the full command line
------------------------------------------

kvm_getprocs is NOT used. Uses sysctl to read kernel mem instead (doesn't work when run as a normal user, has to be run as root).

kp[entry].kp_proc.p_comm only has truncated executable leafname in it.

*** getprocline in print.c gets the whole argv ***
